Develop a structured relational database for child well-being indicators
Populate and manage tables representing various poverty metrics by country
Implement SQL views to simplify complex queries
Perform comparative and trend analysis on child poverty data across countries

🛠️ Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL):	Database creation, querying, and data analysis
Views & Joins:	Simplified multi-table querying and reporting
Relational Tables:	Store country data, poverty indicators, population stats, etc.
